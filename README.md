# Vietoris-Rips Complex: A New Direction for Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation

Abstract:

Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has emerged as a promising solution to alleviating the cold-start problem by leveraging information from an auxiliary source domain to improve recommendations in a target domain. Most CDR techniques fall under a category known as bridge-based methods, but many of them fail to include the structure and rating behavior of target users from the source domain into the recommendation process. Therefore, we propose a novel Vietoris-Rips Complex for Cross-Domain Recommen- dation framework called VRCDR. Specifically, we utilize the Vietoris-Rips Complex (a technique from computational ge- ometry) to understand the underlying structure in user be- haviour from the source domain, and include the learned information into the recommendation process to make rec- ommendations more personalized to usersâ€™ niche preferences. Extensive experiments on large real-world datasets show that VRCDR improves recommendations compared to state- of-the-art bridge-based CDR methods.
